Every time you open the file, remember to save, commit and sync! Otherwise you will need to delete the entire project from your computer, and any changes you made will be deleted. If this happens, go to wherever you saved the project and delete it all, and then re-sync the project in github.

Try to open the project as few times as possible, as you'll need to re commit even if you didn't make any changes.
